    <p>A Thanksgiving Classic, Made From Scratch</p>

    <p>Green bean casserole, that salty, creamy veggie side dish that so many of us love has somehow become nearly as synonymous with Thanksgiving dinner as the turkey itself. Maybe you love it because you grew up eating it every year at Grandma's house. Or maybe you love it because your family never served it and so it represents a savory, creamy, forbidden fruit of the holidays. Or, maybe you really don't love it, but someone you love loves green bean casserole so you're definitely making a green bean casserole every year no matter what. Whatever your reason, we'd like to let you know that just because you've got to make green bean casserole doesn't mean you've got to make the old-fashioned, everything-out-of-a-can green bean casserole recipe! You can make a fresh green bean casserole! From scratch! It's not even harder than the canned version! Seriously! And (duh) this homemade green bean casserole recipe tastes way better than the one that involves opening a bunch of cans.</p>
